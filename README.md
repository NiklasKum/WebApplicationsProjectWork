This folder consists of the root folder of the submission project named "Fullstack-project" and the documentation as a word document. Running the command "npm install" in the root folder should be enough to install all the dependencies required to run the application. When all the dependencies have been installed, run the command "npm run dev" inside the root folder to run the application in development mode. See the documentation for further information
